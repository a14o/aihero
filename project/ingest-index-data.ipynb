In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\\n- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\\n- Attempt collaboration before conflict.\\n- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\\n- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\\n- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\\n\\n## 4.

Weapons Policy\\n\\nNo weapons will be allowed at Quartz community events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\\n\\n## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\\n\\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\\n\\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\\n\\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\\n\\n## 7. Reporting Guidelines\\n\\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. j.zhao2k19@gmail.com.\\n\\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\\n\\n## 8. Addressing Grievances\\n\\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify @jackyzha0 with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\\n\\n## 9. Scope\\n\\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\\n\\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\\n\\n## 10.

You can access the tab sidebar by hovering the side edge of the browser (based on whether `\"Tabs on the right\"` is activated or not).\\n\\nIn Multiple Toolbar or Collapsed Toolbar mode, you can choose which bar to hide. These options are accessible below \"Compact Mode\" > \"Enable compact mode\" when right clicking the toolbar:\\n\\n- **Hide sidebar**: Hides the tab sidebar, accessible when hovering side edge of the browser.\\n- **Hide toolbar**: Hides the top toolbar, accessible when hovering top edge of the browser.\\n- **Hide both**: Hides both top toolbar and tab sidebar.\\n\\n![Compact Mode](/assets/user-manual/compact-mode/enable-compact-mode.png)\\n\\nYou can also use these extra shortcuts to show the hidden bars, suitable for heavy keyboard users.

The decision to focus on **Vertical Tabs** is a core design choice, with the entire Zen Browser experience built around this concept. This approach is intended to maximize screen space and improve navigation, making vertical tabs an essential part of Zen\\'s philosophy.\\n\\n## Will there be mobile version for Zen Browser?\\n\\nAt the moment, our team does not have the time or resources to develop Android or iOS versions of Zen Browser. Additionally, we believe that Zen’s unique features, particularly its design around vertical tabs, do not translate well to the mobile form factor. As such, we do not currently have plans to develop a mobile version of Zen Browser.\\n\\n## Why can\\'t Zen Browser play DRM-protected content?\\n\\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\\n  This only affects Microsoft Windows and MacOS\\n</Callout>\\n\\n<Callout type=\"none\" title=\"What is DRM?\">\\n  [Digital Rights Management](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM) is a technology used to control how digital content, such as videos and music, can be accessed and used.

These builds have been removed because of the following reasons:\\n\\n1. **The optimized version isn't necessarily faster**: Profile-guided optimizations (PGO) aren't working with the optimized version because Clang fails to handle them properly, leading to a crash. As a result, we cannot build optimized versions if we want to include both PGO and Link Time Optimization (LTO). Additionally, AVX2 increases power consumption and is not ideal for heavy parallel computations.\\n\\n2. **AVX2 isn't supported everywhere**: There are still many devices that don't support AVX2 instructions, which makes the installation process more confusing.\\n\\nIn conclusion, having optimized builds is not really worth it, especially if we want to have PGO & LTO.\\n\\nP.S. all optimized builds will be automatically updated to generic starting from version `1.0.2-b.4`.\\n\\nView original [here](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/wiki/Why-have-optimized-builds-been-removed%3F)\",\n",

Example of commonly installed extensions includes ad blockers, easy reader mode, privacy and tracking managers, media downloaders, password managers, and tweaks for commonly used websites.\\n\\nSince Zen is based on Mozilla Firefox, you can install extensions from the same source: https://addons.mozilla.org. \\n\\n![Mozilla Add-ons](/assets/user-manual/extensions/mozilla-addons.png)\\n\\n<Callout> Due to fundamental difference on how Zen does theming, Firefox themes are not supported in Zen. </Callout>\\n\\n<Callout title=\"Difference between Extensions and Zen Mods\"> Extensions are made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This might result in failure when applying or accessing the feature using a custom shortcut you assigned. If a Firefox shortcut is not available in the Keyboard Shortcuts settings, you won\\'t be able to use it as a custom shortcut yet.

      "For Windows and Linux, Zen Browser used to have the option to download optimized builds. These builds utilized AVX2 instructions to improve performance. These builds have been removed because of the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The optimized version isn't necessarily faster**: Profile-guided optimizations (PGO) aren't working with the optimized version because Clang fails to handle them properly, leading to a crash. As a result, we cannot build optimized versions if we want to include both PGO and Link Time Optimization (LTO). Additionally, AVX2 increases power consumption and is not ideal for heavy parallel computations.\n",
